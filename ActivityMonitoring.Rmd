```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Reading data

We stop the process if the csv file is not in the working directory.  
Storing data into a data frame, without addressing NA's

```{r read}
file <- "activity.csv"
  
if (!file.exists(file)) {
        stop("activity.csv file not found")
}

activity <- read.csv(file)
summary(activity)
```
